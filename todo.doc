===========================================================================
To Do List - 7/27/98  


******** FIRE RULES ARE SPELLED OUT AT BOTTOM OF FILE
******** ADD ALL NEW STUFF HERE FOR EVERYONE:

			- auto-Tourney after 20 wins in NFL.C was all wrong;
			    FIXED but make sure we want this rule as it currently stands
			- run-time restart of "Text section is trashed" check in ATTRACT.C looks bogus:
			    file name, start address
			- alert player that play is saved when cap times out
			- The sound gets all static like sometimes!  Like a blown speaker - multiple sightings
			- Nintendo wants "Controller PAK" or "Controller PACK"?
			- definitely have to fix the arm wave slide while white bug.
			- turned fire off snd needs to play later so you can hear it
DONE		- don't do bitch slap QB move when he is jumping in the air!
DONE		- hear the huh huh huh monkey snd all the time when defense is on fire!
			- miss the bowling pin snd sometimes - when it is a forward stiff arm
			- fix goal line def from 20 yd line in - turbo on, adjust assignments
			- fix bog - get Mike to look at this debug 5 yard line bog
MAYBE		- vs page was just a black screen!
			- drone QB is too spastic.  His passes get deflected 50% of time, we
				should have a different deflect % for drone passes
			- put the s back into credit: - the word freeplay needs all the space I was
				trying to save, so why not let credits:00 overlap balls too.
MAYBE		- when on fire and you get tackled, the ball carrier hits the ground but can be
				pushed, slid, cylindered further down the field - like 5-10 yards further.
				We need a play over when the tackle happens.
DONE		- move team logos/city name further to the right in amode mugshot display
DONE		- move right hand side names over to the left on same page
DONE		- lateral from info whack out at kickoff start
			- stay alert for bad tm color matchups and fix them in teamdata.c
DONE		- play editor text as dictated by Nintendo - N64 controller pack - not memory card
			- snds are getting cut off
DONE		- stiff arm snd is weak - when ball is used?
			- don't turn on fire for your cpu teammate.  Not needed.
DONE		- heard tacks on xtra point speech for f.g.
DONE		- play 2 explosion snds at same time
DONE		- when DB pushes down WR, it is silent or real quiet
DONE		- make getups faster - interceptions, etc.
			

##################################################################################################
JASON
##################################################################################################
			- figure out why so many passes are missing
			- in 2v2, make sure second human lines up over human receiver
			- have drone QB hurdle away in a different direction than attacker
			- drone QB is too spastic on quick passes
			- guys on punt stand by ball and don't pick it up
			- had a fumble into opponents endzone, touchback, but it doesn't register it as a lost
				fumble
			- longer passing range when on-fire?  Does this work?
			- WR jumped OB for a catch
			- need to address run around the corner against the drones
			- need to address two human team getting guy on fire in a drone game - go knock
				heating up guy down sometimes!
			- when interception lands ob, the incomplete box appears on screen without a plate
				old bug from first game - maybe new id stuff Jason did will solve it?
			- I fumbled, my guys wouldn't go for loose ball, and I couldn't switch players
				to try taking anyone over so I could go get it.  Lots of guys right nearby!
				check if in lockup ? unint ? maybe break out of it
			- strengthen goal line def, suicide blitz, etc.
			- put in season rating feature like N64 Blitz
			- improve drone QB - logic overall
			- raidens hat is back side culled
			- goal line defense has human controlled guy all the way to one side of screen (no lockup in red zone ?)
			- PASSES GO OUT OF BOUNDS
			- with new formations, and create a play, the man covering the man in motion glitches badly
            - get drones into position for lateral from another drone!  If they are in trouble,
				look for a dish off possibility (at point of contact...if drone open... lateral to him..handicap)
			- Allow onside kicks at start of 2nd half
            - get rid of saw tooth motion on QB
            - make drones harder if human is on a >=4 game win streak!  Does this work?
            - when a drone is running up field, even with blockers in front of him, he tends to
                go to the sidelines, sometimes give him a wild hair and cut inside, this may cause a
                bowling pin move, but even if it doesn't, it would be good variety!
            - have drone WR stiff arm cheap shot DB when DB is trying to tackle him when ball is in air
			- Have drones try to get on fire, and break up heating up WR's on other team
			- audits for new plays - low priority
DONE		- optimize CPU bog
DONE		- don't do hurdle passes 100% of time - drones
DONE		- guys can't pick up ball at their feet!  Happens in amode if you watch long enough...
DONE		- allow drone WR's to push DB's - at least at line of scrimmage
DONE		- make sure fifo check works for old hardware on streaming audio movie
DONE		- 5 wins doesn't let me design more plays
DONE		- automatic change player on QB when WR catches pass fwd of LOS and QB is offscreen
DONE		- fire gets turned off when you do an onside kick
DONE		- team on fire lost ball on downs but stayed on fire
DONE		- powerup field selection stuff
DONE		- sometimes the WR's don't highlight - 7/30/98
DONE		- changing players from QB to go help block doesn't switch my guy to a teammate
				downfield near the action - maybe the change player butn doesn't work while pass
				is in air from QB -  that's when you want to change!

##################################################################################################

            - shards effect on big hits
			- on team select page... if hit turbo button... show rosters
            - have guy get up and celebrate his touchdown if he got tackled
DONE        - put in scream/thud on new stiff arm with ball
DONE        - put in random stop/breathe seqs, sometimes dive, some times take a couple more steps, etc.
                this should be put into drone code

DONE		- JEFF - the offscreen speedup is happening when I'm trying to cover a guy offscrn!
				Then when the pass is thrown to that WR, I'm way far away from him and he has an
				easy catch!  Disallow offscrn speedups until the ball has advanced over the LOS.
DONE		- pain reaction getups glitch
DONE		- don't do monkey moves against a guy if he is in endzone
DONE		- don't do puffs once play has started
DONE		- after on fire defense switched over to offense, the next play he ran glitched
				the turnover on downs message onto the screen.  Even though it was going
				to be second down
DONE?		- lateraled to a teammate after an endplay camera spline had already started,
				thus allowing guy to run while camera was moving - ala the blocked FG
DONE		- monkey move needs speech call
NO			- preload all tm sel textures?  Team sel still feels bad...
DONE		- make head plow stiff arm be random with regular front stiff arm
DONE		- do loud hit snds table when an intended WR gets stuck
DONE		- get rid of NFLPA icon on vs page - put back in the old cheerleader icon

DONE		- get rid of fire on monkey moves

DONE		- get different dirt clouds for astro turf
DONE		- on screen communication of fire on/off for both def & off

				happens to guy who is blinking/heating up
DONE		- guys do stiff arm sometimes without hitting turbo
DONE		- you can dive right through a human WR down field?
DONE		- put in "found created plays" plate after initials entered
DONE		- get old bongo snds back for play select and menu selections
DONE		- make sure we have I'm queer snd call back

##################################################################################################
DAN
##################################################################################################
			- do a big head stick type code on tm select
DONE		- do a powerup code on vs page that sets quarter times to 15 seconds for play testing
				and also give human team 3 points!
				remember to take it out for ship!
DONE?		- missing lower left hand corner of general hints box at game start
				possible overlap by score plate team logo
FIXED		- camera stays looking at ball on FG at buzzer
DONE		- trivia hi score page
			- It needs polish, but I like the kickoff camera working in attract mode on a normal play
			- do DAN camera rules - add cool shit camera paths in amode gameplay
			- multi color football powerup
FIXED		- camera glitches on pick up over back and toss away move - follows ball?
FIXED		- make tournament mode eliminate the no highlight powerup
DONE		- new features page needs whack thru, and we need to print text - the header is not centered
DONE		- on trivia contest - 1-3 random pts for each question
DONE		- make free game text screen different for 4 player game - left or right side of screen

DONE?		- new credit page backdrop
DONE?		- new highscore page backdrop
DONE        - some day, highlight initials of the two players who just finished a game when we show the
                high score pages.  We go to hiscore pages after each game when initials were entered to
                allow player to see where he now ranks/stacks up!  We should highlight his name if it does
                happen to appear!
			- Do a powerup that must be agreed upon, "No fire allowed"
			- Under some conditions, add two seconds to end of VS page in drone games.  The message will
				read: "TOUGHER DRONES ACTIVATED" - then a series of powerups will flash under this message
				alerting the player that he is in trouble.  This will only happen after 10 games of
				experience.  It will not happen in games 20-30, because supposedly, tournament mode
				is set for those games (We should check this).  The once a guy is a grand cchampion,
				the drones always turn on some powerups on VS page.  Some of these powerups can be
				bogus.  (Ex. Secret powerup #2 activated)
DONE (TEXT LOWER)- text overlaps transition plates - make plates higher?

FIRE RULES

DEFENSE:

Activated after 2 consecutive losses by offensive team
After first loss of yards, the entire defensive team blinks white at the LOS
If 2nd loss was a sack (the usual way, jumping OB is another way), then do the Dan
	camera work that does 3 quick cuts of the sack
After the 2nd loss of yards, the player nearest the QB begins flaming non stop as he runs around
	and we display a message above his teams turbo bar/bars that says: "TEAM 1 ON FIRE"
If it was a drone team that just achieved fire, the player nearest the QB catches on fire and goes into
	a taunt sequence

The reward for Defensive fire:
	- Entire team blinks red at LOS before the snap
	- Entire team grows 5-10% in size
	- The linebackers go into blood anim seq.
X	- Super blitzing powerup turned on
X	- Unlimited turbo
X	- Create more bobbles when sticking a WR who just caught ball
X	- Intercept more when jumping up to intercept - no bat downs
	- Defensive fire carries over to offense.  The motion man is the "fire" receiver on offense

Defensive fire goes away on any score or any first down

OFFENSE:

Activated after same guy catches 3 plays for a gain
Heating up guy blinks white after 2 catches
Upon hitting guy who is heating up, fire puffs ignite on body and ball.
If he doesn't bobble ball, the ball continues to flame as he runs and a message appears
	above that teams turbo meters that says: "TEAM 1 ON FIRE"

The reward for Offensive fire:
	- All 3 weapons blink red at LOS before snap
	- "Super on fire WR" has smoke puffs at LOS before snap
X	- The "Super on fire WR" will not bobble the ball once he touches it	
X	- Unlimited turbo
X	- No fumbles are allowed except for spin abuse
	- QB gets one bitch slap of would be sacker
X	- Monkey moves are activated
X	- Super blocking powerup activated
	- All passes are a super fast pass - no distinction between turbo/regular
X	- No deflections of a pass are allowed - ball can still be intercepted if guy jumps up

Offensive fire goes away on any loss of yards or any turnover - including punts
